- X<sub>B</sub>, Y<sub>B</sub> the shift when you press 'B' button
- X<sub>F</sub>, Y<sub>F</sub> coordinates at destination
- You can only increase the position (going right or forward)
- A<sub>P</sub>, B<sub>P</sub> are the A presses and B presses needed
- All the numbers are integers so the remainder of division must always be zero
